# AGENT.md — Amiglot UI

## Design docs discovery
Before starting any task in this repo:
1) Always read `designs/000-architecture-guidelines.md` before coding.
2) Scan the frontmatter of all files in `designs/`.
3) Read the docs whose `whenToUse` matches the task at hand.
4) Use those docs as the source of truth for decisions and constraints.

## Design docs location
- `designs/` (all design docs include `description` + `whenToUse` frontmatter)
